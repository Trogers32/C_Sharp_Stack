dotnet restore

ProjName.csproj: the file that references every dependency for our project. 
Any time we make add or remove packages, we must run the dotnet restore command, 
which initiates a script that reads the .csproj file and triggers NuGet to download 
the appropriate packages. 
(Upon initial creation of a project, this script is automatically run.)
